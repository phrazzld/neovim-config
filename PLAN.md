# Neovim Startup Optimization Plan

This document outlines a structured, agile, and data-driven plan to optimize Neovim's startup time, reducing it from the current 1-3 seconds to a near-instant launch (target: <500ms). The approach involves iterative changes, each followed by measurement and validation, to address specific performance bottlenecks in the configuration. The plan prioritizes high-impact strategies first, leverages tools like Lazy.nvim for deferral, and uses profiling to guide further refinements.

## Identified Bottlenecks

The following issues contribute to slow startup times:
- **Numerous `require` statements in `init.lua`**: Forces plugins to load synchronously at startup, undermining lazy loading.
- **Large number of plugins**: Over 50 plugins, some unnecessary, increase overhead.
- **Synchronous operations**: Plugin setups (e.g., `require("go").setup()`) perform heavy initialization during startup.
- **Dynamic colorscheme selection**: Randomization and multiple colorscheme plugins add small delays.
- **LSP and Treesitter initialization**: Potential inefficiencies in early setup.
- **Autocommands**: Registered at startup, possibly adding minor overhead.

## Optimization Strategies (Prioritized by Impact)

1. **Defer Plugin Setup Using Lazy.nvim** (High Impact)
   Shift plugin loading to when needed, minimizing startup work.
2. **Reduce the Number of Plugins** (Moderate to High Impact)
   Decrease plugin overhead by removing non-essential ones.
3. **Simplify Colorscheme Selection** (Low to Moderate Impact)
   Eliminate dynamic switching overhead.
4. **Profile Startup Time** (High Potential, Diagnostic)
   Identify and target remaining bottlenecks.
5. **Consolidate Configuration Files** (Low Impact)
   Reduce `require` calls by merging small modules.
6. **Optimize Lua LSP Configuration** (Low Impact)
   Improve Lua editing performance, with minimal startup effect.
7. **Minimize Synchronous Operations** (Moderate Impact)
   Defer heavy tasks post-startup.

## Execution Plan

### 1. Defer Plugin Setup Using Lazy.nvim

**Goal**: Reduce startup time by deferring plugin loading until triggered by events, commands, or keymaps.

**Steps**:
- Identify all `require` statements in `init.lua` (e.g., `require("user.cmp")`, `require("user.telescope")`).
- Refactor each corresponding module (e.g., `user/cmp.lua`) to export a `setup` function:
  ```lua
  local M = {}
  M.setup = function()
    local cmp = require("cmp")
    cmp.setup({ ... }) -- Existing configuration
  end
  return M
  ```
- Update `lazy.lua` to configure plugins with appropriate triggers and call the `setup` function:
  - **CMP**: `{ "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp", event = "InsertEnter", config = function() require("user.cmp").setup() end }`
  - **Telescope**: `{ "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", cmd = "Telescope", config = function() require("user.telescope").setup() end }`
  - **Gitsigns**: `{ "lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim", event = "BufReadPost", config = function() require("user.gitsigns").setup() end }`
  - **Nvim-Tree**: `{ "kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua", cmd = "NvimTreeToggle", config = function() require("user.nvim-tree").setup() end }`
- Remove the `require` statements from `init.lua`.

**Measurement**:
- Run `nvim --startuptime startup.log` after each deferral.
- Analyze `startup.log` to confirm reduced startup time (e.g., from 3s to <1s).

**Trade-off**: Slight delay when first using a feature (e.g., entering insert mode for CMP).

---

### 2. Profile Startup Time

**Goal**: Pinpoint remaining bottlenecks after deferring plugins.

**Steps**:
- Generate a startup log: `nvim --startuptime startup.log`.
- Review the log to identify slow operations (e.g., specific plugins or autocommands).
- Use findings to prioritize subsequent optimizations (e.g., targeting a plugin taking 200ms).

**Measurement**:
- Compare logs before and after deferrals to quantify improvements.
- Target components exceeding 50ms for further optimization.

---

### 3. Reduce the Number of Plugins

**Goal**: Lower overhead by eliminating unnecessary plugins.

**Steps**:
- Audit `lazy.lua` to list all installed plugins.
- Remove or comment out non-essential plugins:
  - Examples: Multiple colorschemes (`catppuccin`, `tokyonight`), niche language plugins (`vim-coffee-script`).
- Consider lightweight alternatives (e.g., `oil.nvim` instead of `nvim-tree.lua`).
- Test functionality after each removal.

**Measurement**:
- Run `nvim --startuptime startup.log` after each change.
- Expect moderate reductions (e.g., 100-300ms per significant removal).

**Trade-off**: Loss of some features or conveniences.

---

### 4. Simplify Colorscheme Selection

**Goal**: Remove overhead from dynamic colorscheme switching.

**Steps**:
- Replace `require("user.colorscheme")` in `init.lua` with a fixed colorscheme:
  ```lua
  vim.cmd("colorscheme rose-pine")
  ```
- Remove unused colorscheme plugins from `lazy.lua` (e.g., keep only `rose-pine`).

**Measurement**:
- Check `startup.log` for a small reduction (e.g., 50-100ms).

**Trade-off**: No dynamic theme switching.

---

### 5. Consolidate Configuration Files

**Goal**: Minimize `require` calls by merging small modules.

**Steps**:
- Identify small configuration files (e.g., `user/options.lua`, `user/keymappings.lua`).
- Move their contents into `init.lua` or a single file (e.g., `user/config.lua`).
- Remove corresponding `require` statements from `init.lua`.

**Measurement**:
- Measure via `startup.log`; expect minor savings (e.g., 10-50ms).

**Trade-off**: Reduced modularity, potentially harder maintenance.

---

### 6. Optimize Lua LSP Configuration

**Goal**: Reduce LSP overhead for Lua files.

**Steps**:
- Modify `user/lsp/settings/lua_ls.lua`:
  ```lua
  workspace = {
    library = vim.api.nvim_get_runtime_file("", true),
    checkThirdParty = false,
  },
  ```
- Apply and test with a Lua file open.

**Measurement**:
- Minimal startup impact; verify via editing performance.

**Trade-off**: None significant.

---

### 7. Minimize Synchronous Operations

**Goal**: Shift heavy synchronous tasks post-startup.

**Steps**:
- Identify synchronous setups (e.g., `require("go").setup()`).
- Defer them using `vim.defer_fn`:
  ```lua
  vim.defer_fn(function() require("go").setup() end, 100)
  ```
- Apply selectively to avoid delaying critical features.

**Measurement**:
- Check `startup.log` for moderate gains (e.g., 50-200ms).

**Trade-off**: Delayed feature availability.

---

## General Guidelines

- **Version Control**:
  - Create a branch: `git checkout -b optimize-startup`.
  - Commit each optimization separately (e.g., `git commit -m "Defer CMP setup with Lazy.nvim"`).
- **Testing**:
  - After each change, verify keymaps, plugins, and core functionality.
- **Measurement**:
  - Use `nvim --startuptime startup.log` consistently.
  - Log results in a table (e.g., `| Step | Time (ms) | Notes |`).
- **Iteration**:
  - Revisit profiling after major changes to adjust priorities.
  - Stop when startup time is <500ms or diminishing returns are observed.

---

## Expected Outcomes

- **Initial Goal**: Reduce startup from 1-3s to <1s with deferrals (Step 1).
- **Stretch Goal**: Achieve <500ms with plugin reduction and further tweaks (Steps 2-7).
- **Data-Driven Adjustments**: Profiling ensures efforts focus on the most impactful areas.

By following this plan, Neovimâ€™s startup will become significantly faster while retaining essential functionality, with each step validated through measurement and testing.
