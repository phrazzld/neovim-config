# Neovim Config üõ†Ô∏è

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, written in Lua. It is designed to provide an efficient and feature-rich development environment with the Rose Pine colorscheme, robust LSP support, and efficient code navigation.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Rose Pine Theme**: Beautiful and consistent colorscheme with light/dark mode support
- **Full LSP Support**: Integrated with Mason for easy LSP server management
- **Intelligent Code Completion**: Using nvim-cmp with LSP integration
- **Fast Navigation**: Telescope for fuzzy finding and Hop for quick movement
- **Git Integration**: Gitsigns and Fugitive for seamless Git workflows
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Trouble.nvim and todo-comments for easy issue tracking
- **Language Support**: Preconfigured for TypeScript, Lua, Go, Rust, Python, and more

## Structure üìÅ

- `init.lua`: Main entry point that loads all modules
- `lua/user/`: Contains modular configuration files:
  - `lazy.lua`: Plugin management using lazy.nvim
  - `lsp/`: LSP configuration with handlers and language-specific settings
  - `colorscheme.lua`: Rose Pine theme configuration with light/dark mode toggle
  - And many more feature-specific modules
